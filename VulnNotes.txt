# HTTP Request Smuggling

- Reflected XSS -> HTTP Request Smuggling (Rewatch Defcon talk -- I forgot what this means...)
- Check robots.txt for 404 errors (or any 404 pages) -> Perform TE.CL desync to bypass front-end
- Try JSON post parameters as GET parameters (or just normal POST requests)
- Look for endpoints that store request data persistently (Notes, Account Information, Emails, etc)
